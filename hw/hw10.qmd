## Problem HW10-1

> Assume we have $4$ observations, $(-1,0,1,10)$, where the last observation can be thought of as an outlier. Assume that conditional on an unknown parameter $\theta$, the data area i.i.id. from some population distribution. Assume a standard normal prior for $\theta$.

### (1)

> First, assume that the population distribution is a normal distribution with mean $\theta$ and variance $1$. Draw samples from the posterior of $\theta$ using a Metropolis algorithm and also derive the exact posterior in closed form.


### (2)

> Now assume the population distribution is a Cauchy distribution with location parameter $\theta$ and scale $1$. (This is equivalent to a nonstandardized t distribution with one degree of freedom and location parameter $\theta$.) Draw samples from the posterior using the Metropolis algorithm.

### (3)

> Plot the exact posterior density from part $1$, together with kernel density estimates from the two Metropolis samplers. Describe how the outlier has affected the posteriors.
