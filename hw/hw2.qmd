## Homework Description


> Read Chapter 3 in the Hoff book.
>
> Then, do the following exercises in Hoff: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.12.
>
> For problems that require a computer, please do and derive as much as possible "on paper." Then, for the parts that do require the use of a computer (e.g., creating plots), you are free to use any software (R, Python, ...) of your choosing. No need to include your code in your write-up. Just make sure you create a single pdf file for submission here on Canvas.
>
> For computations involving gamma functions (e.g., 3.7), it is often helpful to work with log-gamma functions instead, to avoid numbers that are too large to be represented by a computer. In R, the functions lbeta() and lgamma() compute the (natural) log of the beta and gamma functions, respectively. See more here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Special.html

## Problem 3.1

> Sample survey: Suppose we are going to sample 100 individuals from a county (of size much larger than 100) and ask each sampled person whether they support policy $Z$ or not. Let $Y_i = 1$ if person $i$ in the sample supports the policy, and $Y_i = 0$ otherwise.


### (a) Assume $Y_1,\dots, Y_{100}$ are, conditional on $\theta$, i.i.d. binary random variables with expectation $\theta$. Write down the joint distribution of $Pr(Y_1 =y1,\dots, Y_{100} = y100|\theta)$ in a compact form. Also write down the form of $Pr(\sum Y_i = y|\theta)$.


### (b) For the moment, suppose you believed that $\theta\in\{0.0,0.1,\dots,0.9,1.0\}$. Given that the results of the survey were $\sum^{100}_{i=1} Y_i = 57$, compute $Pr(\sum Y_{i} = 57|\theta)$ for each of these 11 values of $\theta$ and plot these probabilities as a function of $\theta$

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
