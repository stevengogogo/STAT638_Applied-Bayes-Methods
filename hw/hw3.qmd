> Do the following exercises in Hoff: 3.8, 3.9, 3.14.
>
> In Exercise 3.9, you should be able to avoid "brute-force" integration by exploiting the fact that the Galenshore distribution is a proper distribution, meaning that the density of the Galenshore(a,b) distribution integrates to one for any $a,b>0$.
>
> For 3.14(b), note that $p_U(\theta)$ is proportional to the density of a known distribution.
>
> Please note that while there are only 3 problems in this assignment, some of them are fairly challenging. So please don't wait too long to get started on this assignment.

## Problem 3.8

> Coins: @diaconis1985 suggest that coins spun on a flat surface display long-run frequencies of heads that vary from coin to coin. About $20\%$ of the coins behave symmetrically, whereas the remaining coins tend to give frequencies of $\frac{1}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$


### (a)

> Based on the observations of @diaconis1985, use an appropriate mixture of beta distributions as a prior distribution for $\theta$, the long-run frequency of heads for a particular coin. Plot your prior.

### (b) {#p-3-8-b}

> Choose a single coin and spin it at least $50$ times. Record the number of heads obtained. Report the year and denomination of the coin.

### (c)

> Compute your posterior for $\theta$, based on the information obtained in [(b)]()

### (d)
