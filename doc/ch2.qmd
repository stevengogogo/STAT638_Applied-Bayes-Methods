## Events and partition

- Sample space $S$
- Partition
    - a collection of sets $A_1,\dots, A_m$
    - $A_{i} \cap A_j = \emptyset$
- Conditional probability 
    - Let $B$ be an event, and $A_i,\dots,A_m$ be a partition of $S$
    - $P(B|A_i) = \frac{P(B\cap A_i)}{P(A_i)}$
- Bayes rule
    - $P(A_j |B) = \frac{P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}{\sum^{m}_{i=1}P(B|A_i)P(Ai)}$

## Example: COVID test

> A college with a Covid-19 prevalencde of 10% is using a test that is positive with probability 90% if an individual is infected, and positive with probability of 5% if the individual is not.

> - For a randomly selected student at the college, what is the probability that the test will be positive?

$$\begin{align}
P(+) &= P(+|C)P(C) + P(+|H)P(H)\\
     &= 0.9*0.1 + 0.05*0.9\\
     &= 0.135
\end{align}$$

> - Give that a student has tested positive, what is the probability the student is actually infected?

$$\begin{align}
P(C|+) &= \frac{P(+|C)P(C)}{P(+)}\\
       &= \frac{0.9*0.1}{0.135}\\ 
       &= 0.67
\end{align}$$

## Random variables and univariate distributions

|RV|Discrete|Continuous|
|---|---|---|
|Outcome $y$|countable|uncountable|
|prop. of pdf|$0\leq p(y) \leq1$|$0\leq p(y)$|
||$\sum_{y\in Y}p(y)=1$|$\int_{Y}p(y)dy = 1$|
|cdf $F(a)$|$F(a) = \sum_{y\leq a}p(y)$|$F(a)=\int^{a}_{-\infty}p(y)dy$|
|mean|$E(Y)=\sum_{y\in Y}p(y)$|$E(Y)=\int_{Y}y p(y)dy$| 
: Random variable is an unknown quantity characterized by a probability distribution

- CDF: $F(a) = P(Y\leq a)$
- Variance: $Var(Y) = E(Y-E(Y))^2 = E(Y^2) - (E(Y))^2$

## Joint distribution

|Discrete|Continuous|
|---|---|
|$P_{y1}(y_1)=\sum_{y_2\in Y_2}p_{Y_1, Y_2}(y_1, y_2)$|$p_{Y_1}(y_1) = \int_{y_2}p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)dy_2$|
: Marginal

- Conditional: $p_{Y_2|Y_1}(y_2|y_1) = \frac{p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)}{p_{Y_1}(y_1)}$

## Proportionality

- A function $f(x)$ is proportional to $g(x)$, denoted by $f(x) \propto g(x)$
    - $$f(x) = cg(x)$$
